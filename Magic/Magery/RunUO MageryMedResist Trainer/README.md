Trains Magery/Med/Resist to GM on RunUO shards that do not have anti-macro code enabled.

Setup Instructions:

1) Stand next to secure in house.
2) Place regs in bag inside secure.
3) Place bandages in top-level of secure.
4) Open secure.
5) Set %healathits and %healdelay variables.
6) Leave %backpack %secure and %regsecure at 'menu' to target at start, or hard-code the values in.
7) Press play.

NOTE: Does not work with LRC suits apparently. And no I am not updating the script anymore. Script was tested and working on a Pre-UOR shard only.

If you use it, please rate it.
