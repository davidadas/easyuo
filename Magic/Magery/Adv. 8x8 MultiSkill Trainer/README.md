Author's Notes:
V1.10b Lich Form no longer heals you since its not really needed and causes lag (being a lich you wont die with 0 hp). The fix that was implemented and discussed by other members isn't really good because it will get you killed with other spells. So I just removed healing all together when doing Lich Form.
Added Display Error messages instead os sysmessages
