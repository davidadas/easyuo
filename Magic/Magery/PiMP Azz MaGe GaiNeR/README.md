Purpose: Cap your magery fast as possible!
===============================================


UPDATED 1/7/05 - Implemented HyperTypers sub to fix a problem with lower mana cost raising a variable above your #maxmana!

=================DESCRIPTION=====================
This is the FASTEST Script available to gain magery!! My buddy used it with the gear I state at the bottom of paragraph 3 and he got his magery to 110 in a little under 5 hours completely unattended!! Im sure its possible to do it a lil faster!! I say that because this script is unlike any other magery script in that it'll do everything for u and milk the gains lines much better then any script out there!!

Ok the script will find a gain and immediatly stop on a gain and move 8 forward, it will then proceed to cast the spell according to your skill level again! If the spell is not successful it will recast the spell over and over till it is succesful and not lose the gain line becuase it went past the 5 or whatever fail counter, BUT it will immediatly move on if it successfully casts the spell without a gain and not sit there casting it 4 or however
more times when your not gonna gain! Also If it moves forward and doesn't get a gain it'll move 16 spacesback and try to gain on a 8x8 backward run from your original gain spot (im yet to find another script out there that actually does this, youd think it would be common sense seeing as the 8x8 utility on askchopper is pretty popular!)

The script is basically setup to be fully automated, its has step by step status telling what its doing or needingat all times! It will auto detect your wand and determine what its -skill is to adjust the spell casting accordingly! U can use any spell channeling mage weapon with the script but youll have to target it for the script to detect it! It will support a Staff of Power and detect and implement its Recovery!! It will detect Fast Cast/Fast Cast Recovery jewels and determine how much Recovery you have combined to determine how long to wait between casts! It also has a boat block!

I didnt put any lag detection in the script and im not sure if it'll be too fast for some of u, if any of you have a problem with it being too fast please post your issue for me to read and ill do what i can! Your gonna cap your
skill the fastest using a 100% LRC(Lower Regeant Cost) medable suit with 2/6 casting and Meditation & Focus Pointed up! For those unfortunate souls out there without these resources at hand, u should still use your best casting jewels and best medable LRC equipment! Just load regs on your char for the spells youll be casting at your ADUJUSTED skill level(after penalty from your wand/mage weap)!
They are:

0-25.0 Fireball Sailing Slow Forward
25.1-39.9 Fireball 8x8ing
40-51.9 Lightning 8x8ing
52-60.9 Energy Bolt 8x8ing
61-74.9 Flamestrike 8x8ing
75-Your Cap Earthquake 8x8ing

NOTE: The boatblock is designed for sailing in a straight line north to south to and from ice island, this is the way ive always done it! Not only are the gains great but I RARELY ever run into another person sailing or any ships!! If u choose to sail along the server line please dont vote for my script cause your gonna be bummed that they boat block only turns you around and doesnt sail around the ship! I could change this but I see no need to as the gains are just as good from ice as the server line and its still completely unattended!!
