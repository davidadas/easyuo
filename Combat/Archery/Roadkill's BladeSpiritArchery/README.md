Version 1.9 10 Aug04, added a bunch of tweaks. Read my post.

If you can find a safe spot to stand this will take you to 120 all by yourself using Blade spirit scrolls, or regs if you have decent magery :) You can stand on one side of those small rivers and target across, works well. Or park a boat anywhere.
You can only gain off BladeSpirits when you have around 80 archery since they are 90wrestling. Therefore, you can use this script from about 60 archery if you add +20 archery jewelry; just be sure that your skill with jewelry is at least 80 or you won't gain. Read thread to learn how to get up to 65 or so.
Enjoy!
