:arrow:
### I n f o r m a t i o n
Download the script.

Open the script in EUO and press play.

The script should calculate your faster casting, your recovery, and your LMC.

Check the box for meditation or no meditation. [note: requires 50.0 meditation minimum.]

If using the jewelry trick [see note "Jewelry Trick"] press the checkbox and indicate how much ninjitsu skill your jewelry set adds.

EXAMPLE! If you have +12 Ninjitsu on your ring and +13 Ninjitsu on your bracelet, you would put 25 in this box because it is your SKILL GAINED FROM JEWELRY.

Press HIYAH! to begin your ninja training.

The Jewelry Trick... explained
The Jewelry Trick is a somewhat well known skill gain method of Ultima Online that provides an easy way to raise skill. The first thing that the method involves is using jewelry to raise your skill to the skillcap (one thing that is rather misleading is the word jewelry, you can use any item with a skill bonus for the skill you are trying to raise). For instance, in our case, say your character has 75.6 Ninjitsu, and your Ninjitsu skillcap is 100. You must have at least a +25 Ninjitsu skill bonus from items in order to take advantage of this method of skill gain. Once your skill is at its cap using items, you must use the skill or cast the spell that would normall make you gain skill at your skillcap. Even if your base skill is something like 80, in which case, for Ninjitsu, your character would normally be using Focus Attack for skill gain, you would now have to use Death Strike for skill gain. The second part of the method involves GETTING a gain. Once your base skill raises you will not see it in the UO window (unless you use UOAssist) because your skill is "capped." EasyUO has no problem tracking these gains (it used to for Ninjitsu =] ). Once you get what is called the "initial gain" you must STAY IN ONE SPOT, and do the SAME activity over and over again EXACTLY. If the jewelry trick is working successfully, you will gain a skill point on EVERY successful attempt at using the skill. In the case of this script, if you are using the jewelry trick, as soon as you get a gain, the boat will STOP immediately and continue using death strike repetitively.
:!:An Important Note
If you have more than 75.0 Ninjitsu (or whatever skill you have set to cast Focus Attack, default is 75.0) or will be using the jewelry trick, I recommend wearing a suit with very high mana regen and/or high LMC or having very high focus or meditation, as Death Strike costs 30 mana each time and Focus Attack costs 20. The rate at which you regenerate mana is the main determining factor in how fast the training goes.FOR BLUE PLAYERS ON SHARDS OTHER THAN SIEGE OR MUGEN:You must have your boat in 8x8 lane in TRAMMEL, you must NOT BE GUILDED, and you must have a PET on the boat with you. FOR RED CHARACTERS OR CHARACTERS ON SIEGE OR MUGEN: the script now should work for you! however IT IS VERY, VERY, VERY SLOW I am sure. You have to summon a mirror image, and then strike it. This means you need even MORE mana and more time.
Frequently Asked Questions
* Why can't I hit my pet!? (deathstrike/focusattack)
The solution to this problem lies in the animal which you are trying to hit. Are you using a horse? Do you have absolutely no weapon skill? If you have zero weapon skill, the first step is to buy at least 30 weapon skill from an NPC. The second step is to get a pet that is very easy to hit, such as a bunny. You will find that you strike much more often.
* Why are my mirror images attacking me?! (mirrorimage)
This is absolutely normal. And yes, you will get anatomy/tactics/weaponskill gains from it. The reason for this lies in the fact that mirror images take up follower slots. In order to continue casting mirror images, you must first get rid of the ones pre-existing by attacking them.
* Can you make it so the script will disarm my weapon and rearm it when I meditate? (general)
Perhaps someday in the future. For the time being, the best choice is to use a spell channeling weapon.
* Can I use this script on my murderer character or on Siege Perilous/Mugen above 75.0 skill? (deathstrike/focusattack)
YES! As of version 4.0, you now can. HOWEVER, it is very slow and tedious as your character must first summon a mirror image and then death strike/focus attack it. This means it will require even MORE mana and time (read the note above)
Gains on my shard travel south! Can you modify your script for my shard!? (general)
Turn your boat around. Duh.
* Can I train this skill in Felucca?! (general)
You can train the skill in Felucca only until you reach the point when you begin using the jewelry trick or using Focus Attack / Death Strike. This script requires that your character be in Trammel to gain using those skills, unless you are a murderer or playing on the Siege Perilous or Mugen Shards (please see the important note above).
OMGZ! I am using the jewelry trick and it is taking so long to find a gain run!!! WTF?! (jewelrytrick)
There is nothing you can do to speed this process up. Yes, it takes a very long time to find the "initial gain," but once you do you gain very quickly.
* I was gaining using the jewelry trick... and suddenly it stopped gaining! WTF?! (jewelrytrick)
Yes, this does happen. You can sometimes "lose" a jewelry trick gain run. Yes, it takes a very long time to find that initial gain, and it sucks to lose it, but the script will eventually find it again.
For legacy and sentimental purposes, I have moved the old version of the script to page 6 of this thread ( http://www.easyuo.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=91269#91269 ) for those of you interested in seeing the inner workings of the script. I hope to eventually move it to my own script library thread.
