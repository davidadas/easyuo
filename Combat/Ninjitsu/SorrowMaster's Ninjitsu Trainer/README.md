inally, version 1.0 is released! Test out his new version!!

Thanks again to my betatester Malagahn (if you find this script useful, consider donating him some ScriptBits for his work :) ).
It worked flawless for him and flawless for me, so I decided to release this version to the public.

Before you start the script, please read the instructions. People who do not read them and post stupid questions will be shot. Any survivors of this will be shot again :D

;Instructions! Read before use!!###
;##################################
;
;
;Get on a boat and sail to the long serverline between
;Skara and Moonglow. Turn your boat North. You should wear
;an armor with a lot manareg (+2 items with crappy resists
;are very cheap these days). Take an animal with you (for
;best results, take something easy to hit such as a rabbit).
;You MUST leave your guild, you must be in trammel and your
;animal has to be [tame].
;If there are ANY problems with the script, drop me a
;message at the proper thread, related to this script. Do
;not PM me about this and please wait for a fix (which usually
;comes fast when I get enough information) until you rate the
;script.
;Press play and enjoy. There is no fancy looking panel, no
;statistics or other things. Just a fire and forget 8x8 macroer.
;
;The script will be updated to use jewelery in some time.
