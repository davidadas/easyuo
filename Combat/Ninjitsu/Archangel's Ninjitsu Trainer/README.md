This is one of the few scripts designed to train you in the fine arts of Ninjitsu!

You must not be in a guild and in Trammel to use this script from 70 to 120 as you will be attacking a pet. This script requires you to use a horse, which is great I think since you can mount it and just recall onto the boat. Be sure to have a weapon equiped in your hands by time you hit 70 or you will get an error telling you to have something equiped! Another suggestion is to try to wear some high LMC or Mana Regin armor and have high Med and/or Focus as you will be going through mana fast once you hit 50+.

I have used this script and went from 20 to 120 in just a few days with little to no problem (using the jewlery trick).

If you have ANY issues at all, please let me know and I will gladly resolve them ASAP! And PLEASE vote for my script. Thank you!

I have changed the script to being download form so I can being to track how many people get my script and use it. From what I can tell, the script is complete and ready to be used full force, with or without EUO supporting Ninjitsu!

Thank you and happy gaining! I hope you achieve Ka-Ge Ninja as I have![/b]
