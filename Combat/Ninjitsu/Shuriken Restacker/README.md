This was a request from someone. The only way this will work correctly is with don't move mouse cursor turned off. I repeat:

THE ONLY WAY THIS SCRIPT WILL WORK IS WITH DON'T MOVE CURSOR OFF.

(Go to Tools, Options, Uncheck "Don't Move Cursor".)


This script is hot. I am infinitely aroused by this script. This script will take as many Fukiya darts or shuriken, combine them from 1-2 use items into many 10 use items, and then poison them. All that is required is:

For shurikens:
A leather ninja belt
Shurikens

For Fukiya Darts:
A Fukiya
Fukiya darts

For poisoning:
A whole ton of poison potions that you wish to use. Support for kegs will be in later versions.

For curing:
Bandies, Regs, LRC, or Tithing Points. Support for potions will be in later versions.

CHANGELOG:
11/10/04: Version 2.0
* Many MANY MANNNNNY changes.
* Now works with Fukiya darts.
* Will now poison after restacking, if you choose.
* Will cure you if you fail poisoning by the method of your choice.

* New totally menu driven interface.

11/7/04: Version 1.0
* Initial release of the script.
