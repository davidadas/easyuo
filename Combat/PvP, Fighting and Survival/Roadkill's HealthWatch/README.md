Tested with UltraTamer 5.0
This was written to be used with my "UltraTamer" but I made it standalone too.
This is a "plugin" script that can be called from any script that needs monitoring of hits, poison, food consumption, escape recalling, and keeping a defensive spell up. It passes info to some global vars if you want to do other stuff in your calling programs.
Or just launch it solo while you run around.
