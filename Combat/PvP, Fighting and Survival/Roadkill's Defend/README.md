Ok folks, I thought there needed to be a good AUTO DEFEND script that could be run on it's own, OR used as a "plug-in" called file for other people's scripts that need some form of defense. So, here it is. Read the comments and config section. There are a few lines to be remarked/unremarked for use as a called file or a standalone executable.
Lastly, there there are 3 global variables, which look very complicated. They are not, really, I just wanted to make the script POWERFUL, and make it have all the hooks you could want/need. You dont have to use them, however, many script writers will find the exposed hooks nice/useful for passing control and info between the scripts. Look at the 3 scripts RoadkillsUltraTamer, RoadkillsHealthWatch, and this one RoadkillsDefend, to see how I use the global vars to shuttle control between 3 complex scripts.
