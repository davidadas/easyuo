Finally, version 1.0 is released! Test out his new version!!

Thanks to my betatester Malagahn (if you find this script useful, consider donating him some ScriptBits for his work :) ), who spent exactly 8 hours to test out the script. In these 8 hours he gained: Bushido 82.2 82.2 +( 82.2)
It worked flawless for him and flawless for me, so I decided to release this version to the public.

Before you start the script, please read the instructions. People who do not read them and post stupid questions will be shot. Any survivors of this will be shot again :D

;Get on a boat and sail to the long serverline between
;Skara and Moonglow. Turn your boat North. You should wear
;an armor with a lot manareg (+2 items with crappy resists
;are very cheap these days).
;If there are ANY problems with the script, drop me a
;message at the proper thread, related to this script. Do
;not PM me about this and please wait for a fix (which usually
;comes fast when I get enough information) until you rate the
;script.
;Press play and enjoy. There is no fancy looking panel, no
;statistics or other things. Just a fire and forget 8x8 macroer.
;
;There will be NO! version which uses the jewelery trick, since
;the passive moves do not gain to your cap.
;
;Cap - Maximum of skill you can gain with this macroer
;100 - 97.5
;105 - 100
;110 - 102.5
