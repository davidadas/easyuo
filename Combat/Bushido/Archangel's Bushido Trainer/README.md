This is one of the few scripts designed to train you in the fine arts of Bushido!

You must not be in a guild and in Trammel to use this script from 97 to 120 as you will be attacking a pet. This script requires you to use a horse, which is great I think since you can mount it and just recall onto the boat. A suggestion is to try to wear some high LMC or Mana Regin armor and have high Med and/or Focus so you don't end up waiting on mana.

I have used this script and went from 20 to 100 in ~24 hours with little to no problem. Going above 100 does take a while though if you try to macro it.

If you have ANY issues at all, please let me know and I will gladly resolve them ASAP! And PLEASE vote for my script. Thank you!
