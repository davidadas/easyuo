Comments:
This script is designed to work up a variety of skills, with one easy to run script. I have gone to great efforts to make this a click'n'play script, as I do with all my scripts. As you select a skill from the pull down menu, you will get a display screen in the menu that gives you a detailed report on what will be needed for each skill prior to clicking play.

I have placed a ton of fail-safe's into this Script. If your skill is pointed down, it will ask if you want it turned up, and do it for you. If you do not have at least 25.0, it will ask you to head to an NPC and train at least 25.0 skill, so you save time training. I have gone to the extreme on each skill, to ensure that you are performing at the maximum ability training, within reason. During this Multi-skill trainer, I will RARELY update with bugs that come and go, so this script will be stable and steady. You will see standalone trainers that will use the flirty bugs for speedy training. Bob will display a ton of information for you to view while your training, eye candy as I call it just for viewing pleasure. Generally I display Starting Skill, Current Skill, # of Gains, Last Gain Time, Training Time, Cost of Training and a live updating Script Status. Depending on the skill training I may or may not display more or less.

This script displays the Skill Images on each menu. This is NOT required, but does give the script a nice display for cosmetic reasons only. To display the images, download skill_images.zip. Unzip the folder and drop it into your EasyUO Folder. SuperBob (Multi-skill Trainer) MUST be in your upper most EasyUO folder as well.

Detailed Skill Information:

CARTOGRAPHY:
Trains Cartography from 0 to 99.5 crafting Maps out of blank scrolls.

Designed around players not having Tinkering. So you MUST have a bag inside of your secure chest that is designated for just Mapmaker's Pens. You will need approx 40-50 Exceptional Pens and around 5000-10000 Blank Scrolls. Once you reach 99.5 you will need to decipher Treasure Maps for the last 5 gains.
