V. 14.2
1. Now has the option to turn your logs into boards using your axe.
   YOU WILL HAVE TO SET %RESTART TRUE AT LEAST ONCE SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE SETTING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING MY SCRIPT.
2. I have changed %Slow_Swing_Speed to 20 instead of 35 since I can now reduce my weight by simply using my axe on the logs. IF you can't convert logs to boards by using an Axe I suggest changing it back to 35!


IF YOU ARE USING MULTIPLE CLIENTS WITH THIS SCRIPT

IT is suggested as of RIGHT NOW that you run them out of different houses/secures. For some reason using two characters out of the same secure will crash your client. (Or just use the bank... which i forgot to fix... crap....) Also Having your house in the same LAND as where your runes are marked is also suggested. Lumberjacking in FEL HOUSE IN FEL. THAT IS ALL.

To Those Who have been Using MY script for a while, Or those who are Freshly Downloading it and have scripting experience. Try Out The New SUPER ADVANCED SETTINGS!

Its Only 3 Variables, But They are KEY Delays As Far as Speed Goes. I'm At 23k Logs per hour right now! Before I Could only do about 19k logs per hour! The Settings that it is currently on are the fastest I have found for OSI, But Post your Results and the Shard you Play on!

Instructions:
Step 1:
Get at Least Two Runebooks
The First FULL of Runes Next to Trees
The Other With One rune marked next to your secure, or at your Bank.
Name Your Book/Books with Tree Runes "TREE" (Or have The Word TREE in the name)
Name your Book with your Home/Bank Rune in it "HOME"

Step 2:
Make Sure Your Character has a 100% lrc Suit on Or enough Tithing to sacred journey around ALOT.

Step 3:
Make Sure you have an Axe. Preferably Spell channeling if you are using magery to recall.

Step 4:
Hit Play and Follow the Setup

If you wish to change your settings after you have gone through it once, just set %restart True and play the script again

Be Sure to set %restart False After doing this So you don't have to go through the setup every time :)


Set %enemy To the Types of enemies You wish to run from.
"If you don't Know what A TYPE Is Go to the Documentation Board and Find out :)"
For instance,
set %enemy XU

For Multiple Types of enemies Put A _ inbetween each type
set %enemy XU_FB_YRC
If it finds any of the types you set, It Will Move on to the next rune QUICKLY.

set %menu True IF you want to see my menu!
Suggested, as In the Future I might make it to where it runs slower if you don't HAHAHAHA <---Now Thats Funny

For Those of you with BREAKABLE AXES.

set %BreakableAxe True (I should of asked for money for this)
Have Plenty of axes in your secure container. Once you run out the Script stops. No Ifs Ands Or Butts.

V 14.0 <- The Final Version
1. Removed All Goto's Out of Subs and out of Loops
   (Guess the Mods Never Read my Script :) )
   2.Changed a Few Variables to make them..... More Yeah....
   ( Example %BlahBlah to %Tree_Book_Number )
3. Removed Logs To Boards. Deal With It
4. Totally Revamped Breakable Axes
5. Totally Revamped Equipping Axes
6. Simplified About 100 Lines of code into about 10.
   (Update thats Smaller than the Original! OH YEAH)
7. Added The Ability To change KEY Wait Times In the Script So you Can Tinker with the Settings to Optimize your Butt Kickery
8. Removed a Pointless wait 15 from the script... What was I thinking...











Diagnostic Mode:
It updates the status of what is happening in the script during key moments and posts it on the menu. Due to the speed of my script, when in diagnostic mode, it adds a 1 second wait everytime the status is updated. Without these waits, some of the actions are only a BLUR on your menu HAHAHAHA.

Please Post any Problems you Run into By including The status' displayed on the Menu During diagnostic Mode around the Time of error in the Post.

Such as.

Waiting For Postion to change.
Move Failed Recalling again.


Notes:

1. You May want to download CyberPopes Lumberacky Radar.
   http://www.easyuo.com/forum/viewtopic.p ... 864#220864
   Due to the new Nature of my script you can lumberjack more than one set of trees at each recall spot. Try using Cyberpopes lumberjack script to figure out runes that will Have you within two tiles of multiple Lumberjacking areas. If you only place each rune close enough to lumberjack one set of trees with each recall, I almost guarantee it will lumberjack all the trees in your book before they respawn! :D

2. If you have a problem with this script and post a complaint, Please check the Forum regularly because I R haxxor and Like to solve problems quickly with quick responses.

3. Also, if you just don't like my script. You can either get mental help, or write your own!!!! And Always remember.....
