Axe needs to be equipped for this script to start

Script is fully automated ( out of the box ready ) You can bypass these settings at the beginning of the script and hard set ids and times and bypass the auto setup if you know how to script.

This was made for only one reason. To raise my wood chopping skills to better use my Axe Of The Heavens damage to its full potential :wink: . However it is a nice simple script that will bring up a target that you simply click on a resource spot. It will drain it dry and produce another target telling you to move on to the next spot. It will also tell you when you are over weight and I have added the basic journal checks that may other wise cause the script to hang. Enjoy and have fun with it. I will gladly answer any questions but there will be no additions for this script.

Added the ability to mine ore and cut kindling. The script now asks what you would like to do so it can properly set wait times, and it now allows you to target your axe/shovel/bladed weapon depending on what you want it to do instead of entering it into the script. It also tells your when you are getting close to over weight and when you are the script will loop until you unload. Still the same simple script where you target your location and it will pull all the resources from that spot.

Updates:
Will now smelt ore when you reach your weight restriction. Simply walk up to a forge while overweight and the script will do its thing.{{{V1.3}}}
Will now find another shovel when one breaks{{{V1.3}}}
Changed wait to Target. decreases digging and target time.{{{V1.4}}}
Gives message when overweight to dump or smelt{{{V1.4}}}
Some small code changes and a small timing fix{{{V1.5}}}
Updated script to drop resources to ground if slected in script{{V1.6}}}
