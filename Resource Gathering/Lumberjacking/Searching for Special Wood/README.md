First of all let me say thank you to Cheffe.

Searching for Special Wood Trees!

This script is designed to help lumberjacks with the tedious task of finding special wood trees, chopping them, making boards and sending them to the bank.

This script is specifically designed to make it easier and faster to find special wood trees. You can set it so that when it is looking for special wood trees it will stop chopping when Oak or Ash are found or when it chops a trees six times and only gets regular wood. Or you can set it to chop each tree until there is no more wood left. Once a special wood tree is found (Yew or better) the script will ask you if you want it to pause so that you can mark the spot.

There are also settings to drop regular and/or oak and/or ash logs to the ground and to use carpentry to make boards out of all logs that you are keeping and to use a bag of sending to send logs and special resources to the bank when you are close to being overweight.

Everything is menu driven and there is a setup menu that allows you to change the setting once the script is running.



Please give it a try and let me know what you think.

Version 1.00 - Initial release

Version 1.10 - Added Menu as per suggestions and made use of the bag of sending optional but turned on as the default option.

Version 1.20 - Added a setup menu, the ability to use carpentry to make boards, the choice of which wood types to drop, and the ability to fully chop each tree or to search just for special wood.

Version 1.21 - Added additional check to see if the user is overweight and if so then excute the overweight subroutines. Warning - this fix will kick in only when you backpack cannot hold any more weight, which if 550 stones. If you have your status bar open then this option should not be necessary. I also added in some code to move the carpentry menu to a default position so that making boards would work correctly even if the carpentry gump had been moved.

Version 1.21a - Added space on a line continuance that was causing a logic problem and droping bloodwood and frostwood logs. Oops!
