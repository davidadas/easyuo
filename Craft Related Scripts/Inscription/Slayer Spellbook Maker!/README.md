I almost didn't publish this, im sure it will degrade the value of slayer books by alot.


Heres what the script does:
1.makes Spell books Quickly.
2.grabs scrolls from a container or bankbox and continues to make books.
3.Trashes non Slayer spellbooks and continues to make even more books.


What you need:
a)Scrolls in your bankbox or in a Secure container.
b)A trashbarrel or bank trashcan close enough to drop things into.
c)pens in your backpack


Important things to do before starting:

open your backpack, and drag it to an area it will not be covered by the Inscription Menu.

Open your secure or bankbox with scrolls in it.

Hit play and follow the instructions on the screen.

put your Spellbook in your hand, and have no important spellbooks in your backpack, or they may be trashed.


Thats it! Enjoy.
