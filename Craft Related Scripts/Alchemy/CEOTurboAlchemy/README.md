CEOTurboAlchemy 2.2
Click here for what's new with 2.0

This script needs the latest EasyUO latest OSI Client. It may work for most RunUO Freeshards using the latest client, but the Alchemy menu needs to be the same menu as an OSI shard. Also, this script uses Event Property. Only Clients 4.x.x have that ability!

The client must be set to english. This is a requirement for any script that examines #property or #journal for specific phrases.

Choosing a training/skill table: If you are on a RunUO/Freeshard ONLY use the tables with RunUO in their names. Conversely, these tables WILL NOT work for an EA shard. IE, if you're on an EA shard, use any table EXCEPT the RunUO ones. Understand? When you select a training table, the script adjusts for that kind of shard, using a table not designed for your shard will cause the script to have problems.

If you need to modify stuff for freeshards (button positions most likely) see this post: HERE. Do not post any further freeshard issues, it's just not supported and you're on your own.

This is my second script in the "Turbo" line of scripts.

Look familar? It should, it's core is from CEOTurboTailor, reworked for Alchemy. It only needs one thread and is just as fast!

Here's the feature list:
You can use at a bank or in your house. (Auto-detects)
One-time setup, it'll reopen your bank/secure/resource bags the next time you run it without doing any file saving.
Remembers even more then CEOTurboTailorusing the patent pending CEO*Filesystem. :)
Tinkers mortar tools if you have tinker skill and iron ingots.
Tinkers Tinker's tools for perpectual mortar tools. (just keep the ingots coming!)
If you have hiding skill it'll hide you (and rehide you if needed).
A very nice stats/progress screen (see below)
And of course like my other Turbo script, it's fast!

Note: One caveat, by fast I mean it clicks Make Last fast, leading to good gains. However, at 95 when it switches to Deadly Posion kegs, nothing but lots of nightshade and patience will get you to GM. Still saves your fingers and wrists though!

Average resources used. Thanks to Googleyflub for compiling this list!

Note: Resource container must be in bank box or house secure. See this linkfor more information.

I'm not going to detail the instructions, everything you need (ignoring tailor specific comments) can be found in the CEOTurboTailor thread.
If you're unsure about anything, read the CEOTurboTailor setup instructions, except for tailoring stuff, it's pretty much the same setup/requirements for this one. Too much to retype and I don't think many people read them anyways. The setup of this script is pretty self-guiding and only needs to be done once.

As usual, please post your comments and problems in this thread. I'd greatly appreciate it if you drop a post here when you've skillcapped your character and tell me your statistics and how well the script performed. Please rate the script as well so that others will be benefit from your experience with this script.

Note, if you are having problems and want to post about it, help me out by including this information in your first post: EasyUO version with build, Client Version, OSI/FS, your current skillcap, current alchemy skill, and characters stats.

Done GMing? Want to turn this into an endless potion-keg maker of your choice? A few simple mods to the script described herewill do it. Also this post from Gadabout_Guy tells how to make stuff with black pearl (it's not used in this script).

Thanks to the following testers asked to beta and actually provide me with feedback and helped me squash those nasty bugs: Slammer, Sheia, Jackd, Mornadak, DarkLotus, Aastrom


Thank you and enjoy!
